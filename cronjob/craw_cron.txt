# Cron Job Configuration File
# This file contains the cron schedule for automated execution of the crawler script
# Format: minute hour day month weekday command

# STEP 1: Cron time specification
# * * * * * means run every minute
# Field 1: Minute (0-59) - * means every minute
# Field 2: Hour (0-23) - * means every hour  
# Field 3: Day of month (1-31) - * means every day
# Field 4: Month (1-12) - * means every month
# Field 5: Day of week (0-7, 0 and 7 are Sunday) - * means every day of week

# STEP 2: Change to working directory
# cd command ensures we're in the correct directory before execution
# This is important because cron jobs run with minimal environment

# STEP 3: Execute the bash script
# /bin/bash run.sh executes our main script with full path to bash interpreter
# Using full path ensures the script runs regardless of PATH environment

# STEP 4: Output redirection
# >> logs/iris.log redirects standard output to log file (append mode)
# 2>&1 redirects standard error to the same location as standard output
# This captures both success messages and errors in the same log file

* * * * * cd /home/quandv/Documents/fsds/m1/linux/scripts/cronjob && /bin/bash run.sh >> logs/iris.log 2>&1
